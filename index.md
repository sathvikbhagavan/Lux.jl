    details: Lux.jl is written in Julia itself, making it extremely extendible. <u><a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl">CUDA</a></u> and <u><a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl">AMDGPU</a></u> are supported first-class, with experimental support for <u><a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Metal.jl">Metal</a></u> Hardware.

  - icon: 🧑‍🔬
    title: SciML ❤️ Lux
    details: Lux is the default choice for many <u><a href="https://github.com/SciML">SciML</a></u> packages, including DiffEqFlux.jl, NeuralPDE.jl, and more.

  - icon: 🧩
    title: Uniquely Composable
    details: Lux.jl natively supports Arbitrary Parameter Types, making it uniquely composable with other Julia packages (and even Non-Julia packages).

  - icon: 🧪
    title: Well Tested
    details: Lux.jl tests every supported Automatic Differentiation Framework with every supported hardware backend against Finite Differences to prevent sneaky 🐛 in your code.
